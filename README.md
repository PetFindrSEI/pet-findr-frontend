## Project Description

Petfindr is the place to go for any pet whether lost or found. If you have lost a pet, you can browse our dashboard to see if anyone has posted about your lost furry friend!

## Planning Process

### User Stories

#### MVP

- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of found pets, so I can search through them and locate my missing pet.
- As a user, I want to be able to report any lost pet that I have found with that pet's information, so other users can see.
- As a user, I want to be able to report my missing pet, so other people can keep an eye out for them.
- As a user, I want to be able to contact the user who posted the missing/found pet, so the family can be reunited.
- As a user, I would like to be able to remove my listing once the pet has been reunited with their family.

#### Stretch Goals

- ✅ As a user, I want to be able to share missing/found pet info on social media, so I can extend the reach of a pet’s post.
- ✅ As a user, I want to be able to filter and sort results based on different qualities, so that I can better find the pet I am looking for.
- ½ As a user, I want to be able to search for specific pets.
- ½ As a user, I want to be able to have my own account, so that I can keep track of my listings as well as users I have contacted.
- ✅ As a user, I would like to see a timestamp of when the pet was posted.
- ✅ As a user, I want to be able to upload a photo instead of a photo URL.





## Major Hurdles / Unsolved Problems

### Unsolved Problems

- Implementing search by name, location, zipcode and other additional parameters.
- Adding the pets to each user so you can easily access them via the user profile page.
- Additional functionality behind the user profile page.

### Major Hurdles

- Getting used to Framer Motion and moving away from typical vanilla CSS animation techniques was a little hard to get used to.
- Bringing in the functionality from the API to get certain user information.
- Persisting the user info and logged in status throughout the site.
